# Hiphonic_Frontend
Hiphonic is a social media platform designed for user engagement with content, connecting with friends, joining groups and events, sharing photos and videos.

The platform was inspired by a Figma UI design, link here https://www.figma.com/design/0czbT2Mstoz2ff9W7jgcfy/TEACH2GIVE?node-id=1-3&t=gPhMC9n8ThpsSI3i-1
It allows users to add posts, add photos, add videos as well as manage their social network connections.
